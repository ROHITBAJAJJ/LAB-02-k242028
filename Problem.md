(ALGORIHTM)


Task1:
Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.
1)	Take Nth number
2)	Take n number
3)	 Use operator which Divides nth number by n
4)	Divide the n/nth number 
5)	IF nth number is Even then Reminder is odd number
6)	IF nth number is Odd then reminder is Even.
7)	 End
